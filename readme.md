README 
In order to use this project solution…

You must first  install the NTLK module then subsequently 5 different NTLK Packages in order to invoke the NLTK API. 
You also must install Teepy in order to mine data from Twitter in a fairly accessible format.

Carefully follow and repeat the steps provided below.

Step 1 [IMPORTANT]
    Open Terminal
    Navigate to where the project folder is located by typing cd + [path]
    Check your python version by typing “python --version” to check the version of your python.
    If your python version is above 3.0.0, type “sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt”
    You have to be using pip3, not pip.
    
Step 2 [IMPORTANT]
    Open the project solution and navigate to the “install_nltk.py” file.
    Run it in the python shell and a downloader should pop up.
    If an error ensues, quit the program. Then navigate to the “if_nltk_error.py” file instead.
    Run  in the python shell and downloader should pop up.
    Download ALL FILES given in the downloader.

Step 3
    By now you should be good to go.
    Navigate to the “run.py” file and see how sentiment analysis works with the NTLK API!
